it's okay, i dont care if the gradio thing works.

give me a working api, that I can try on the trellis-test-images/ in the /tmp/ dir and then see some outputs of .glb files

that is your only test, you don't have to use gradio for this. 

this is your only acceptance criteria. nothing else, more or less is going to judge whether you did your job or not.
